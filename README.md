create a chatbot for IT queries(mini project):-
This mini-project is about creating a chatbox for major IT queries.
A chatbot is a software application designed to simulate human conversation through text or voice interactions. Chatbots use Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and machine learning to understand and respond to user inputs in a way that mimics human dialogue. They can be deployed on websites, mobile apps, social media platforms, and messaging services like Facebook Messenger, Slack, or WhatsApp.
